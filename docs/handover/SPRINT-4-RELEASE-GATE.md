## Stopped At (Hard Blocker)

**Vercel project linking** requires owner to authenticate via `vercel login` and run `vercel link` from `apps/experience/`. All configuration is complete and committed. This is the only hard blocker.

**All other Sprint 4 work is complete.**

## What is NOT in This Release

Per Sprint 4 spec:
- No PSL activation
- No production deployment
- No production wallet activation
- No real sponsor campaign activation
- No sports data provider ingestion activated
- No STORY-40 work

---

## Recommended Next Action

1. Owner runs: `vercel login && cd apps/experience && vercel link`
2. Sets env vars in Vercel dashboard (see `SPRINT-4-DEPLOY-GUIDE.md`)
3. Runs: `vercel --cwd apps/experience`
4. Reviews the visual acceptance matrix (`SPRINT-4-SCREEN-ACCEPTANCE-MATRIX.md`)
5. Approves or requests corrections
6. PR `feature/sprint-4-premium-activation` → `main` when approved
