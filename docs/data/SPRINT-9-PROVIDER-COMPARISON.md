## Key Unknowns (pending trial validation)

1. PSL Premier League fixture availability on Sportmonks
2. WC2026 fixture availability on Sportmonks
3. SportsDataIO PSL/WC2026 coverage on paid plan (not free trial)
4. Rate limits under production load
5. Field completeness for PSL-specific data (jersey numbers, squad numbers)
6. Commercial pricing and licensing for both providers
7. Data freshness (how quickly fixtures update after kick-off)

## Preliminary Assessment

**Sportmonks is the preferred primary candidate** because:
- Adapter is fully implemented and wired to `DataProviderService`
- Uses standard `Authorization: Bearer` header (not query param)
- Prior spike investigation (`tools/data-provider-spike/`) also favored Sportmonks
- SportsDataIO trial scope is limited to UCL — insufficient to validate PSL/WC2026 coverage

**SportsDataIO remains a valid backup candidate** because:
- Adapter skeleton exists and handles auth correctly
- UCL trial validates the auth model and endpoint structure
- Would require paid plan for PSL/WC2026 coverage validation
